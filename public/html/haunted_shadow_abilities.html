				<h5>Otherworldly Patron</h5>
					<p>At 1st level, you have struck  a bargain with an otherworldy being of your choice: the Hexblade. You have made your pact with a powerful, sentient magic weapon carved from the stuff of the Shadowfell. The mighty sword Blackrazor is the most notable of these weapons, several of which have spread across the multiverse over the ages. These weapons grow stronger as they consume the life essence of their victims. The strongest of them can use their ties to the Shadowfell to offer power to mortals who serve them. The Raven Queen forged the first of these weapons. They, along with the hexblade warlocks, are another tool she can use to manipulate events in the Material Plane to her inscrutable ends.</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Pact of the Blade</h5>
					<p>
					You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon  takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Armor of Shadows</h5>
					<p>
					You can cast <em>mage armor</em> on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Grasp of Hadar</h5>
					<p>
					Once during your turn when you git a creature with your <em>eldritch blast</em> cantrip, you can move that creature in a striaght line 10 feet closer to yourself.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Hex Warrior</h5>
					<p>
					At 1st level, you gain proficiency with medium armor, shields, and martial weapons. In addition, when attacking with a melee weapon that you are proficient with and that lacks the two- handed property, you can use your Charisma modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the attack and damage rolls.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Hexblade’s Curse</h5>
					<p>
					Starting at 1st level, you gain the ability to place a baleful curse on an enemy. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target is cursed for 1 minute. Until the curse ends, you gain the following benefits:
					<ul>
					<li>You gain a bonus to damge rolls against the cursed target. The bonus equals your proficiency bonus.</li>
					<li>Any attack roll you make against the cursed target is a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.</li>
					<li>If the cursed target dies, you regain hit points equal to your wrlock level + your Charisma modifier.</li>
					</ul>
					You can’t use this feature again until you finish a short or long rest.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>False Identity</h5>
					<p>
					You have created a second identity that includes documentation, established acquaintances, and disguises tat allow you to assume that persona. ADditionally, you can forge documents including official papers and personal letters, as long as you have seen an example of the kind of document or the hadwriting you are trying to copy.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Feline Agaility</h5>
					<p>
					Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on you turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Cat's Claws</h5>
					<p>
					Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make  unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damge equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.
