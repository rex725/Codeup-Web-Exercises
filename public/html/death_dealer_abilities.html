				<h5>Rage</h5>
					<p>
					In battle, you fight with primal rerocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
					<br>
					While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren't wearing heavy armor:
						<p class='indent'>
						-You have advantage on strength checks and Strength saving throws.
						</p>
						<p class='indent'>
						-When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a 	barbarian, 	as 		shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
						</p>
						<p class='indent'>
						-You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. And all damage types except for psychic with the path of the bear.
						</p>
					If you are able to cast spells, you can't cast them or concentrate on them while raging.
					<br>
					Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a hostile 	creature 	since 	your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
					<br>
					Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a lon 	rest 		before you can rage again.
					</p>

					<p>
					Starting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack of your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly.

					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Danger Sense</h5>
					<p>
					At 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from danger.
					<br>

			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Feral Instinct</h5>
					<p>
					By 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on initiative rolls.
					<br>
					Additionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren't incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.
					</p>
			</div>
			<div class='col-md-6'>
				<h5>Spirit Seeker</h5>
					<p>
					Yours is a path that seeks attunement with the natural world, giving you a kinship with beasts. At 3rd level when you adopt this path, you gain the ability to cast the <em>beast sense</em> and <em>speak with animals</em> spells, but only as rituals.
					</p>
